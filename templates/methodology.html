	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		I used the following data sources:
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Global Terrorism Database (GTD): CSV</span></li>
					<p>The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014.  Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on deomestic as well as transnational terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 140,000 cases.  For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and the nature of the target, the number of casualties, and--when ientifiable--the group or individual responsible.</p>

				<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Big, Allied and Dengerous (BAAD): website</span></li>
					<p>The Big, Allied and Dengerous (BAAD) project looks at a variety of terrorist and insurgent organizations grouped together as violent non-state actors (VNSAs).  The network connections that exist between VNSAs, and the link to countries that host, sponsor, or are targeted by a given VNSA.  Its primary purpose is to enable researchers and analysts to increase understanding of terrorism, insurgency, and links between both forms of violent political action.</p>
